# Introduction

**Context**

The H1B visa is a pathway for skilled foreign professionals to work in specialized fields in the United States. For international students and workers, it represents both an opportunity and a challenge due to its policy-driven nature. As discussions around potential changes to the program gain traction in 2024, understanding how industries, roles, and regions are impacted by such policies becomes increasingly important for navigating the uncertainties ahead.

**Motivation**

The H-1B visa program has long been a cornerstone for skilled international professionals seeking opportunities in the USA. As international students pursuing higher education, we are interested in understanding the potential implications of policy shifts on our future career prospects. Our project examines H-1B visa trends during 2016, a pivotal year marked by a political transition as the Trump administration assumed office. We aim to analyze what changes occurred in industries, states, and job roles associated with H-1B visa sponsorship during that time. While we recognize that the socio-political and economic contexts of 2016 differ from those of today, this retrospective analysis helps us better understand the concerns surrounding the H-1B program in times of policy uncertainty. By studying data from 2016, a year that generated similar apprehensions among international professionals and students, we hope to gain insights that inform our decisions about navigating a potentially similar environment in 2025. This project seeks to provide a data-driven perspective, balancing anecdotal narratives with objective analysis.
