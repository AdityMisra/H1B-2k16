    "text": "1 Introduction\nContext\nThe H-1B visa is a pathway for skilled foreign professionals to work in specialized fields in the United States. For international students and workers, it represents both an opportunity and a challenge due to its policy-driven nature. As discussions around potential changes to the program gain traction in 2024, understanding how industries, roles, and regions are impacted by such policies becomes increasingly important for navigating the uncertainties ahead.\nMotivation\nThe H-1B visa program has long been a cornerstone for skilled international professionals seeking opportunities in the USA. As international students pursuing higher education, we are interested in understanding the potential implications of policy shifts on our future career prospects. Our project examines H-1B visa trends during 2016, a pivotal year marked by a political transition as the Trump administration assumed office. We aim to analyze what changes occurred in industries, states, and job roles associated with H-1B visa sponsorship during that time. While we recognize that the socio-political and economic contexts of 2016 differ from those of today, this retrospective analysis helps us better understand the concerns surrounding the H-1B program in times of policy uncertainty. By studying data from 2016, a year that generated similar apprehensions among international professionals and students, we hope to gain insights that inform our decisions about navigating a potentially similar environment in 2025. This project seeks to provide a data-driven perspective, balancing anecdotal narratives with objective analysis.\nKey Questions\nIndustry Trends:\nWhich industries most successfully obtained H-1B visas in 2016, and how does this distribution compare to other years?\nState-Level Insights:\nWhich U.S. states had the highest number of approved H-1B petitions in 2016, and what factors contributed to their dominance?\nJob Role Distribution:\nWhat were the most common job roles for H-1B applicants in 2016, and how did these roles align with the prevailing demand for skills in the U.S. labor market?\nEmployer Characteristics:\nWho were the top employers sponsoring H-1B visas in 2016, and what trends can be observed about these companies’ size, industry, or location?\nApproval Rates and Salary Trends:\nWere there noticeable trends in the approval rates or salary levels for H-1B petitions in 2016, particularly about job roles, industries, or sponsoring states?",

We can see that missing values in some of the rows is huge (some of them are nearly empty). For example, Public Discolsure location is completely empty. It is possible that these values are not mandatory while filling the H-1B application, therefore leading to lot of missing information.\n\n\nCode\n# Plotting the percentage of missing values per column, sorted by descending missing percentage\nmissing_summary &lt;- colSums(is.na(h1b_data)) / nrow(h1b_data) * 100\nmissing_df &lt;- data.frame(Column = names(missing_summary), MissingPercentage = missing_summary)\n\nggplot(missing_df, aes(x = reorder(Column, MissingPercentage), y = MissingPercentage)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Percentage of Missing Values per Column\",\n    x = \"Columns\",\n    y = \"Missing Percentage (%)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above horizontal bar graph gives a relative view of missing values in all the columns of the dataset. Missing values can, of course, complicate the analysis; however, in our case, the columns with a high number of missing values are not critical to our primary objectives. The data in these columns—such as PUBLIC_DISCLOSURE_LOCATION, EMPLOYER_PHONE_EXT, and EMPLOYER_PROVINCE—serve as supporting information rather than core data required for analysis.\nFor example, columns like PUBLIC_DISCLOSURE_LOCATION only provides metadata about the file’s storage location, which is not directly related to analyzing H-1B visa trends or employer statistics. Similarly, fields such as EMPLOYER_PHONE_EXT and EMPLOYER_PROVINCE primarily address contact details, which are not relevant for our analysis.\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(42)\nsampled_data &lt;- h1b_data[sample(1:nrow(h1b_data), 5000), ]\n\nmissing_long &lt;- as.data.frame(is.na(sampled_data)) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = \"Column\", values_to = \"IsMissing\")\n\nmissing_long &lt;- cbind(RowIndex = rep(1:nrow(sampled_data), times = ncol(sampled_data)), missing_long)\n\n# Plotting heatmap of missing data\nggplot(missing_long, aes(x = Column, y = RowIndex, fill = IsMissing)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"FALSE\" = \"white\", \"TRUE\" = \"red\"), name = \"Missing\") +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Missing Data (Sampled Rows)\",\n       x = \"Columns\",\n       y = \"Row Index\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above missing value heatmap shows that missing data is concentrated only in certain columns. The rest of the columns have little to no missing data. This helps us streamline the data cleaning process.\n\n\nCode\n# Group missingness by CASE_STATUS and calculate the average missing count\ngrouped_missing &lt;- h1b_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(MissingCount = rowSums(is.na(.))) %&gt;%\n  group_by(CASE_STATUS) %&gt;%\n  summarise(AverageMissing = mean(MissingCount)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(AverageMissing)) # Optional: Sort for better visualization\n\n# Plotting grouped missingness\nggplot(grouped_missing, aes(x = reorder(CASE_STATUS, -AverageMissing), y = AverageMissing)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"orange\") +\n  labs(title = \"Average Missing Values by CASE STATUS\",\n       x = \"CASE STATUS\",\n       y = \"Average Missing Count\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart visualizes the average count of missing values for different categories of the column CASE_STATUS which represents the status of H-1B visa application.\nThe average missing values are similar across all statuses indicating no major variation in the amount of missing data among different application statuses. This implies that to handle the missing data, this graph shows that removing missing values wont introduce bias towards a specific case status.\n\n\nCode\nnumeric_data &lt;- h1b_data %&gt;%\n  select_if(is.numeric)\n\nstandardized_data &lt;- as.data.frame(scale(numeric_data))\n\nset.seed(42) \nsubset_data &lt;- standardized_data[sample(1:nrow(standardized_data), 1000), ]\n\nsubset_data &lt;- subset_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(RowIndex = 1:nrow(.)) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = -RowIndex, names_to = \"Variable\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\nggplot(subset_data, aes(x = Variable, y = RowIndex, fill = Value)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"blue\", mid = \"white\", high = \"black\", midpoint = 0) +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Standardized Variables (Subset of Rows)\",\n       x = \"Variable\",\n       y = \"Row Index\",\n       fill = \"Standardized Value\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heatmap displayed is a visualization of standardised values in the dataset for missing values analysis. No visible pattern was found on the plotting of this graph indicating that there is no unique relationship between missing values of the columns. Additionally we also observe a fading effect when we take large number of rows. This is due to data being more homogenous, causing the the standarised values to cluster closer to 0. Some of the columns are completely white, indicating high number of missing values in those columns.",

Even in the lowest volume quarters, the majority of processed cases were approved, suggesting a strong tendency towards granting H-1B visas when petitions are properly filed and meet criteria.\nQuarterly Volume Fluctuations:\nConsistency in Status Proportions (beyond Certified): While the largest category (CERTIFIED) overshadows the rest, the relative proportions of DENIED, WITHDRAWN, and CERTIFIED-WITHDRAWN appear fairly steady. Each of these categories consistently represents a small fraction of total cases, implying that the big story lies in when and how many cases are processed, rather than dramatic shifts in approval vs. denial rates from one quarter to another.\nThe Q1 2017 peak likely corresponds with the period when the bulk of petitions for the next fiscal cycle are being processed, reflecting the U.S. government’s typical schedule for reviewing the large volume of H-1B cap-subject petitions submitted in early April of the preceding year. While the chart doesn’t show exact submission dates, it strongly suggests a seasonal pattern in H-1B case volume and finalization.\nThe graph shows a consistent proportion of approvals across quarters, with minor fluctuations in denials and withdrawals. This consistency suggests that, despite a government transition in early 2017, there was no immediate or drastic shift in policy enforcement affecting case outcomes. However, the high number of withdrawn petitions in Q1 2017 could indicate some uncertainty among employers or applicants regarding policy direction under the new administration, leading them to reconsider or withdraw applications during this critical period.",

However, the same industries dominate this category, indicating that companies in Programming Services and Computer Design might face internal or external factors leading to withdrawal post-approval.\nConcentration of DENIALS in Tech Industries: The Programming Services and Computer Design industries also show the highest number of DENIED applications, suggesting stricter scrutiny or potential issues in petition filings for these sectors.\n\nThis could be due to several factors, including:\nHigher scrutiny of petitions in these industries due to past instances of program misuse.\nComplex job descriptions or role justifications that fail to meet the “specialty occupation” criteria. Increased competition leading to marginal cases being rejected.\n\nEducation also features among the industries with notable denials. Denials may stem from challenges in meeting prevailing wage requirements or providing sufficient documentation of role specialization.\nWITHDRAWN Petitions Show Industry Variance: While WITHDRAWN cases are present across all industries, Programming Services again leads. The high volume in tech-focused sectors could reflect dynamic project needs or strategic employer decisions in response to changing business conditions or policy uncertainties.\nNon-Tech Representation Is Limited but Present: Non-tech industries like Education, Engineering Services, and Accountants appear across all categories but in significantly smaller numbers. These industries seem to have lower rejection and withdrawal rates, possibly due to clearer alignment with eligibility criteria or smaller petition volumes overall.",

While the Post-Trump Period covers a longer timeframe (three quarters versus one quarter), the trends still provide valuable insights into regional patterns and the influence of governmental transition on H-1B applications.\nDominance of Key States\nIn both periods, California, Texas, New York, and New Jersey lead in H-1B applications, emphasizing their economic reliance on high-skilled international workers. These states host global companies in tech, finance, and consulting industries, which depend heavily on the H-1B program to meet labor demands. Despite the longer timeframe in the Post-Trump Period, the consistency of these states’ dominance reflects their sustained role as hubs for global talent.\nMinimal Change in Rural and Midwest States\nAcross both periods, rural and Midwest states exhibit low application volumes, as indicated by lighter shading on the maps. These regions’ economic focus on industries such as agriculture and manufacturing likely explains their limited reliance on H-1B talent, a pattern that remains consistent regardless of the political climate or timeframe.",

This pattern suggests that while offering a wage at or above the prevailing wage supports certification, other factors may still lead to petition denial or withdrawal at any wage level.\nOutliers and High-Wage Petitions: A small number of cases offer wages significantly higher than the prevailing wage. Although less common, these outliers may reflect niche roles or employers willing to pay a substantial premium to secure specialized talent.",

Employers may adjust their hiring or retention strategies based on economic or regulatory uncertainties.\nBalanced Demand for New and Continued Employment (Oct-Dec 2016):\nDuring this quarter, the distribution between new and continued employment applications was nearly equal, indicating a steady demand for both hiring fresh talent and retaining existing workers. This period likely reflects employers finalizing hiring plans after the H-1B lottery results and ensuring that current employees’ visas are extended before the fiscal year ends. It’s also a time when companies balance resources between growth and stability.\nSurge in New Employment (Jan-Mar 2017):\nA noticeable increase in new employment applications during this quarter suggests that employers were focusing more on onboarding new talent than renewing existing employees.This trend could be linked to companies preparing for the new fiscal year or addressing fresh hiring needs aligned with annual business objectives. Additionally, employers may have expedited new applications ahead of expected policy changes during a politically transitional period.\nDominance of Continued Employment (Apr-Jun & Jul-Sep 2017):\nIn these quarters, continued employment applications significantly outpaced new employment, suggesting a strong focus on retaining existing H-1B employees. This shift could be due to increasing regulatory scrutiny or higher denial rates for new applications, pushing employers to rely on proven talent already in their workforce. Additionally, renewing visas for existing employees may have been a lower-risk option compared to navigating uncertainties with new hires.",

This consistency likely stems from employers competing in a tight talent market for top-tier, highly specialized foreign professionals, prompting them to offer similar premium compensation packages.\nDespite covering diverse sectors (e.g., Management Consulting vs. Education), the high-end wages remain closely aligned. This pattern suggests that market-driven forces and prevailing wage regulations push companies to meet or exceed certain standardized benchmarks, resulting in a wage ceiling that looks quite uniform across different industries.\nThe log scale reveals some data points trailing at much lower wage levels within each industry, which may represent atypical positions, less experienced candidates, or unique contract arrangements. Even so, the majority cluster at the higher end, reflecting a strong demand for high-skilled talent and a willingness by employers to offer compensation that can attract and retain such workers.\n\n(PS: We are using the 99th percentile here because we want to ignore certain outlier cases, such as wages of 2,000,000 USD.)",

This implies that there isn’t a strong correlation between a specific wage range and a higher likelihood of denial or withdrawal.\nStable Outcome Patterns Across Ranges: The pattern of a substantial certification segment with thin layers of denied and withdrawn cases remains consistent from lower to higher wage tiers. This consistency suggests that while wage might influence the total volume of petitions, it doesn’t dramatically shift the balance of outcomes.",

This pattern indicates that established employers, well-versed in compliance, are adept at navigating the H-1B process to meet requirements and secure approvals.\nWidespread Geographic Distribution with Consistent Outcomes:\nEmployers channel applications into multiple states—such as California, Texas, and New York—yet the outcome remains highly skewed toward certification. This stability across states suggests that while employers leverage diverse geographic footprints, the core processes and prevailing wage justifications they employ lead to similar results regardless of location.\nMinor Proportions of Denials and Withdrawals Amid High Volumes:\nAlthough the diagram shows occasional streams flowing into “Denied” or “Withdrawn” categories, these are relatively thin strands compared to the dominant “Certified” channel. Such minimal deviations likely reflect instances where documentation, job requirements, or market conditions did not fully align with regulatory criteria. Overall, however, the high-certification pattern underscores that large, experienced employers can reliably meet the structured criteria of the H-1B program, achieving success irrespective of the state in which the position is based.",

    "text": "3.10 Uneven Terrain: H-1B Certified Wage Data Deviates Strongly from a Normal Distribution\n\n\nCode\ncertified_data &lt;- filtered_data |&gt;\n  filter(CASE_STATUS == \"CERTIFIED\" & !is.na(PREVAILING_WAGE))\n\nggplot(certified_data, aes(sample = PREVAILING_WAGE)) +\n  stat_qq() +\n  stat_qq_line(color = \"blue\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"QQ Plot of Prevailing Wages (Certified Applications)\",\n    x = \"Theoretical Quantiles\",\n    y = \"Sample Quantiles\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12)\n  ) + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe QQ plot reveals that actual wage quantiles deviate considerably from the theoretical normal line, particularly toward the higher end. This indicates a distribution dominated by a large number of moderately paid positions and a relatively smaller but impactful cluster of very high-paying roles, creating a heavy right tail.\nThe sharp upward curve at higher quantiles suggests that while most certified wages fall within a broad middle range, there’s a distinct subset of specialized positions offering exceptionally high salaries. This premium on certain sought-after skill sets or niche expertise skews the overall wage structure away from the bell-curve symmetry one might expect in a more uniform labor market.\nThe presence of these extremely high wages is likely driven by a combination of competitive employer practices, regulatory prevailing wage benchmarks, and market scarcity for top-tier talent. Rather than forming a neat, normal distribution, the result is a wage landscape characterized by broad variation and a handful of outlier salaries that pull the distribution’s tail upward.",

    "text": "Main Takeaways: H-1B petitions are largely certified, with consistent outcomes across industries and states. Wage distributions highlight a broad mid-range and a smaller cluster of high-paying roles, reflecting demand for specialized talent. Denial rates are low and show minimal correlation with wages, emphasizing the role of qualitative factors like documentation and job specificity.\nLimitations: Our analysis is constrained by the available data and the year studied (2016-2017). Factors such as policy changes, macroeconomic shifts, or evolving industry standards outside this period are not fully accounted for. Additionally, the data do not capture qualitative aspects of job roles, internal hiring practices, or the nuances of legal counsel involvement—factors that can significantly influence success rates. Our statistical measures provide correlational patterns, not causal conclusions, and certain outliers or anomalies remain unexplained without deeper qualitative investigation.\nFuture Directions: An extension would be to examine multiple years before and after the political changes of 2017 to assess longer-term trends and policy effects. Incorporating more granular job and skill data could shed light on which exact competencies command premium wages or face stricter scrutiny. Evaluating employer characteristics—such as company size, track record with H-1B, and geographic footprints—could offer richer insights into why certain firms excel at navigating the system.\nLessons Learned: This project underscores the importance of data-driven approaches in understanding policy-driven processes like the H-1B program. Clear patterns can emerge even in complex systems, such as consistent certification rates and wage dynamics, but quantitative data alone only tell part of the story. Combining numeric insights with contextual knowledge, such as industry trends and policy nuances, is crucial for a holistic understanding and informed decision-making.",
