    "text": "1 Introduction\nContext\nThe H-1B visa is a pathway for skilled foreign professionals to work in specialized fields in the United States. For international students and workers, it represents both an opportunity and a challenge due to its policy-driven nature. As discussions around potential changes to the program gain traction in 2024, understanding how industries, roles, and regions are impacted by such policies becomes increasingly important for navigating the uncertainties ahead.\nMotivation\nThe H-1B visa program has long been a cornerstone for skilled international professionals seeking opportunities in the USA. As international students pursuing higher education, we are interested in understanding the potential implications of policy shifts on our future career prospects. Our project examines H-1B visa trends during 2016, a pivotal year marked by a political transition as the Trump administration assumed office. We aim to analyze what changes occurred in industries, states, and job roles associated with H-1B visa sponsorship during that time. While we recognize that the socio-political and economic contexts of 2016 differ from those of today, this retrospective analysis helps us better understand the concerns surrounding the H-1B program in times of policy uncertainty. By studying data from 2016, a year that generated similar apprehensions among international professionals and students, we hope to gain insights that inform our decisions about navigating a potentially similar environment in 2025. This project seeks to provide a data-driven perspective, balancing anecdotal narratives with objective analysis.\nKey Questions\nIndustry Trends:\nWhich industries most successfully obtained H-1B visas in 2016, and how does this distribution compare to other years?\nState-Level Insights:\nWhich U.S. states had the highest number of approved H-1B petitions in 2016, and what factors contributed to their dominance?\nJob Role Distribution:\nWhat were the most common job roles for H-1B applicants in 2016, and how did these roles align with the prevailing demand for skills in the U.S. labor market?\nEmployer Characteristics:\nWho were the top employers sponsoring H-1B visas in 2016, and what trends can be observed about these companies’ size, industry, or location?\nApproval Rates and Salary Trends:\nWere there noticeable trends in the approval rates or salary levels for H-1B petitions in 2016, particularly about job roles, industries, or sponsoring states?",

We can see that missing values in some of the rows is huge (some of them are nearly empty). For example, Public Discolsure location is completely empty. It is possible that these values are not mandatory while filling the H-1B application, therefore leading to lot of missing information.\n\n\nCode\n# Plotting the percentage of missing values per column, sorted by descending missing percentage\nmissing_summary &lt;- colSums(is.na(h1b_data)) / nrow(h1b_data) * 100\nmissing_df &lt;- data.frame(Column = names(missing_summary), MissingPercentage = missing_summary)\n\nggplot(missing_df, aes(x = reorder(Column, MissingPercentage), y = MissingPercentage)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Percentage of Missing Values per Column\",\n    x = \"Columns\",\n    y = \"Missing Percentage (%)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above horizontal bar graph gives a relative view of missing values in all the columns of the dataset. Missing values can, of course, complicate the analysis; however, in our case, the columns with a high number of missing values are not critical to our primary objectives. The data in these columns—such as PUBLIC_DISCLOSURE_LOCATION, EMPLOYER_PHONE_EXT, and EMPLOYER_PROVINCE—serve as supporting information rather than core data required for analysis.\nFor example, columns like PUBLIC_DISCLOSURE_LOCATION only provides metadata about the file’s storage location, which is not directly related to analyzing H-1B visa trends or employer statistics. Similarly, fields such as EMPLOYER_PHONE_EXT and EMPLOYER_PROVINCE primarily address contact details, which are not relevant for our analysis.\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(42)\nsampled_data &lt;- h1b_data[sample(1:nrow(h1b_data), 5000), ]\n\nmissing_long &lt;- as.data.frame(is.na(sampled_data)) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = \"Column\", values_to = \"IsMissing\")\n\nmissing_long &lt;- cbind(RowIndex = rep(1:nrow(sampled_data), times = ncol(sampled_data)), missing_long)\n\n# Plotting heatmap of missing data\nggplot(missing_long, aes(x = Column, y = RowIndex, fill = IsMissing)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"FALSE\" = \"white\", \"TRUE\" = \"red\"), name = \"Missing\") +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Missing Data (Sampled Rows)\",\n       x = \"Columns\",\n       y = \"Row Index\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above missing value heatmap shows that missing data is concentrated only in certain columns. The rest of the columns have little to no missing data. This helps us streamline the data cleaning process.\n\n\nCode\n# Group missingness by CASE_STATUS and calculate the average missing count\ngrouped_missing &lt;- h1b_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(MissingCount = rowSums(is.na(.))) %&gt;%\n  group_by(CASE_STATUS) %&gt;%\n  summarise(AverageMissing = mean(MissingCount)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(AverageMissing)) # Optional: Sort for better visualization\n\n# Plotting grouped missingness\nggplot(grouped_missing, aes(x = reorder(CASE_STATUS, -AverageMissing), y = AverageMissing)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"orange\") +\n  labs(title = \"Average Missing Values by CASE STATUS\",\n       x = \"CASE STATUS\",\n       y = \"Average Missing Count\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart visualizes the average count of missing values for different categories of the column CASE_STATUS which represents the status of H-1B visa application.\nThe average missing values are similar across all statuses indicating no major variation in the amount of missing data among different application statuses. This implies that to handle the missing data, this graph shows that removing missing values wont introduce bias towards a specific case status.\n\n\nCode\nnumeric_data &lt;- h1b_data %&gt;%\n  select_if(is.numeric)\n\nstandardized_data &lt;- as.data.frame(scale(numeric_data))\n\nset.seed(42) \nsubset_data &lt;- standardized_data[sample(1:nrow(standardized_data), 1000), ]\n\nsubset_data &lt;- subset_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(RowIndex = 1:nrow(.)) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = -RowIndex, names_to = \"Variable\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\nggplot(subset_data, aes(x = Variable, y = RowIndex, fill = Value)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"blue\", mid = \"white\", high = \"black\", midpoint = 0) +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Standardized Variables (Subset of Rows)\",\n       x = \"Variable\",\n       y = \"Row Index\",\n       fill = \"Standardized Value\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heatmap displayed is a visualization of standardised values in the dataset for missing values analysis. No visible pattern was found on the plotting of this graph indicating that there is no unique relationship between missing values of the columns. Additionally we also observe a fading effect when we take large number of rows. This is due to data being more homogenous, causing the the standarised values to cluster closer to 0. Some of the columns are completely white, indicating high number of missing values in those columns.",
